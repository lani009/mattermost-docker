# Mattermost Docker
The **forked** Docker deployment solution for Mattermost.

This repository has been modified from the Official Mattermost Docker repository to use http instead of SSL/TLS, and in the process, the variables in nginx and .env files have been adjusted.

## Install & Usage

Refer to the [Mattermost Docker deployment guide](https://docs.mattermost.com/install/install-docker.html) for instructions on how to install and use this Docker image.
